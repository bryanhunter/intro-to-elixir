# Elixir
### a crisp, new language for the Erlang VM

Presented at [Nash.rb](http://www.meetup.com/nashrb/events/219010780/) on Thursday, January 8, 2014.

### Abstract
Elixir is a modern and expressive functional programming language
that delivers the productivity and "developer joy" of Ruby
and all of the raw power of Erlang.

Elixir was designed to take the best language qualities
of Ruby, Clojure and Erlang. Elixir code runs on the Erlang VM
and compiles to the same binary format (BEAM file) as Erlang,
so it has zero-penalty access to Erlang libraries including OTP.
Just like Erlang, it supports hot code loading and scales beautifully
(scales-up to many cores, scales-out to many machines).
What does it look like? What are the pieces and the tools?
How do I get started with Elixir? Sound exciting? Good!

Come join the fun!
